It is endorsed by South East CDC (SECDC) who has engaged us to be involved with the Community Outreach Programme for the Elderly (COPE) programme in April 2008.

The specific aim of this programme is to provide care and promote opportunities for the elderly residents in the Haig Road area to live an active ageing lifestyle. The programme is supported by South East Community Development Council and Geylang Serai Community Club. 

Along with the eldercare, we are running family and youth programmes as well. This is to support our eldercare services. We believe that an intergenerational approach is a wholesome way to deal with the issues of ageing.

",Volunteering Opportunities,"There are various things that you can help out at the centre. Without a doubt a big part of the work is carried out by volunteers, young and old, skilled and unskilled, rich and poor, of different ethnic and religious background. We invite anyone who has the time, energy and commitment to be involved in our work whether on a short or long term basis.
