A group of philanthropists saw the need to provide equal opportunities for children with intellectual disabilities to receive education and later, to be integrated as contributing and responsible citizens in Singapore.

The Singapore Rotary Club gave the first donation to pilot the project under the Singapore Children’s Society and the first ‘Chin Pu’ (meaning progress in Chinese) school was set up in a single room in Towner Road with 26 children.

‘Chin Pu’ centres mushroomed around the island in whatever premises that were available – churches, disused schools, etc. In 1985, SARC was renamed MINDS to encompass the services provided not only for children, but adults and the aged persons with intellectual disability.

Since then, MINDS has grown to be one of the largest Voluntary Welfare Organisations in Singapore, serving some 2,400 clients from past the age of six to their ripe old age.

It caters to the less privileged elderly living in rental flats. The centres work closely with the local grassroots, schools and other organisations to provide outings, talks, exercises, games, and other activities to these seniors. The centres also act as information hubs and point of contacts.

These services include a centre-based day care programme known as Silver Circle, an island-wide home-based service known as Care@home, management of Senior Activities Centres known as Silver ACE, and the sheltered home know as Henderson Senior Citizen’s Home.

There are currently 8 Silver Circle centres located in various parts of Singapore. The day care programme engages seniors in meaningful and interactive activities during the day while their children are at work. Some centres also provide additional services such as dementia care and active rehabilitation.

Care@home is an island-wide home-care service to look after elderly who are more frail and home-bound. This includes a newly launched home nursing component. NTUC Eldercare also does caregivers training programmes to equip caregivers, including domestic helpers, with basic skills and knowledge on caring for elderly at home.

The Silver ACE centres are Senior Activities Centres which cater to the less privileged elderly living in rental flats. The centres work closely with the local grassroots, schools and other organisations to provide outings, talks, exercises, games, and other activities to these seniors. The centres also act as information hubs and point of contacts.

NTUC Eldercare also manages the Henderson Senior Citizens' Home which is both a sheltered home for needy elderly and a Senior Activity Centre for seniors staying on their own in HDB rental flats. The Home organises activities and programmes to engage these seniors, so that they too can lead happy, meaningful and dignified lives.

NTUC Eldercare currently has 6 centres.

The centres work closely with volunteers from grassroots, schools, VWOs and corporate organizations to organise outings, lunch treats, festive celebrations, interesting social activities, and to engage elderly staying in this community.

The church was started in 1948 at the Fairfield Methodist Girls’ School premises, then located along Neil Road. Founding members of the church have always considered a calling from God to serve the community in Chinatown. In the early 80’s, the school was given an attractive offer by the government to relocate to Dover Road. But the church decided to remain in Chinatown to continue to serve this community.

The destiny seemed to be sealed in 1986 when the church relocated to its current “home” at 1 Tanjong Pagar Road. Situated in the heart of Chinatown, the needs of the local community became very real to the church. In response, many small groups of members started their little “acts of kindness”; distributing food and gifts to the elderly residents, providing free tuition classes to needy students, giving bursaries to the neighbourhood schools to help the needy families, and celebrating seasonal festivals with lonely elderly folks.

The church subsequently decided to have a more concerted effort to provide community service for Chinatown, which resulted in the setting up of Yong-en Care Centre. Yong-en Care Centre was registered as a charitable organization with the Registry of Societies in 1996,independent of the church and governed by its own constitution and has its own members. It remains affiliated to the church, which Yong-en relies as its strongest supply of financial and manpower resources.

Yong-en Care Centre at Chinatown Complex

Through the support from Dr. Richard Hu, Minister of Finance & MP for Kreta Ayer-Tanglin GRC, Yong-en Care Centre was granted a lease at the void space above the Chinatown Complex commercial block. At the Centre’s Official Opening, he expressed his pleasure at seeing YCC working closely with the Kreta Ayer Senior Activity Centre, another major voluntary welfare organisation. Indeed, it is with the local community’s interest at heart that all these have happened.

It is hoped that the establishment of the Centre would help the Chinatown community (particularly senior citizens) to enjoy a greater sense of bonding and find help in times of need.

On behalf of the management team, I sincerely welcome all of you to join the big family at June’s Beauty School. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for trusting us with the solemn duty of educating you and preparing you to face the challenging world ahead. June’s Beauty School was registered and set up in Singapore in 1973. It was one of earliest private schools in Singapore providing courses in beauty and hair with a systematic and methodical approach.

Over the years, many students have walked through our school doors and gone on to be very successful in their respective fields, working as consultants, trainers, beauticians, hair stylists, and even as entrepreneurs and owners of salons.

In our thirty seven years of teaching, we have never stopped improving; developing course content and content delivery methods to suit the times. Even as knowledge in skin care and hair care has grown, and fashionable styles in make-up and hair design have come and gone, some things remain constant. At June’s Beauty School, we constantly emphasize good service, passion and dedication to the profession of beauty and hair styling and the willingness to constantly upgrade one’s skill and knowledge. 

The proof of our service quality is shown in our achievement of CaseTrust certification in 2006. Our school has also been registered under the Enhanced Registration Framework in 2010 and is currently in the process of applying for EduTrust certification (to replace CaseTrust which will no longer be recognized under the new administration of Council for Private Education). Even as we apply for EduTrust certification, we will adhere to the guideline stipulated under EduTrust Certification Scheme, especially with regards of protecting your money under FPS, and your health under the health insurance scheme. 

With all that said, we sincerely hope you will feel at home at June’s Beauty School, especially for those of you who hail from overseas. At June’s Beauty School, we are always willing to lend a hand or a listening ear, so please, do not hesitate to ask for help in anything. Finally I would like to wish all of you the best in your studies here with us.

Pte Ltd is a local TCM company with 40 years of history. While manufacturing and managing Chinese proprietary medicine, it also provides TCM medical and healthcare services. Hence, it is a multi-faceted enterprise that is able to integrate both medication and clinical treatment to offer a seamless service. At the same time, Science Arts strongly believes that TCM is beneficial to everyone in the society, regardless of their ethnic and cultural background. For a long time, Science Arts has regarded the fostering of TCM culture and the promotion of public health as its aspiration.

Through the development of TCM in Singapore, the founders of Science Arts realise that TCM is a trusted medical science for the Chinese community in Singapore in the treatment of illnesses and the maintenance of health. With the rapid economic development in Singapore, TCM has great developmental potential. Since the 1990s, the value of TCM in healthcare has been widely recognised. In order to protect the safety and interests of the citizens, the Government has passed legislative regulatory measures for TCM, thereby enhancing the quality of TCM, making TCM one of the trusted medical treatment options for the public. With this development, TCM practitioners now bear greater social responsibilities and obligations. In order to safeguard public interests and maintain a competitive edge in the industry, practitioners have to constantly upgrade their specialised knowledge and refine their clinical skills so as to keep up with the times, to enable them to provide better and more professional services to the general public, alleviating their pains and illness while enhancing their health.

From years of accumulated experience, the management of Science Arts believes that in order for TCM to achieve sustainable development and to better serve the community, there is a need to enhance the confidence of the general public in TCM. Through further education provided outside of formal TCM training, the TCM industry is able to enhance the treatment efficacy of TCM; on the other hand, by educating the general public, it enables them to have the proper knowledge and understanding of TCM medical and healthcare services. Over the past few years, Science Arts has been committed to the active propagation of TCM culture through different channels, spreading it in various forms.

Since the early 1990s, Science Arts has conducted several hundreds of TCM healthcare talks. Through these selfless exchanges between TCM specialists and the general public, accurate and scientific concepts and knowledge of TCM treatments and healthcare were transmitted to the public thereby fundamentally enhancing public health awareness and increasing the correct scientific understanding of TCM healthcare applications. The talks were highly popular and Science Arts will continue to hold such talks to share new TCM knowledge with the general public.

In recent years, TCM has developed rapidly in Singapore, with a significant increase in the number of local and overseas TCM college graduates practicing in Singapore. In order to let professional TCM physicians further their education, keep up with new developments and enhance their professional standards, Science Arts has conducted over 15 professional TCM training courses in the last 5 years. Highly experienced specialists and professors were engaged as lecturers for the courses which have seen over 400 participants attending. The courses conducted included “Preparation Workshop for TCM Physicians Registration Exam”, “TCM Bone Injury Massage (Tui-na) Techniques”, “Bone Therapy and Manipulation Techniques”, “Bone Therapy Massage Techniques”, ” Essential Nutrients for the Human Body – Dietary Planning and Supplements”, “X-ray Diagnosis and Application of Massage (Tui-na) Techniques for Bone Injuries & Illnesses” and “Family Massage (Tui-na) Techniques” etc. These courses were very well received and have also attracted the participation of many TCM enthusiasts.

At the same time, Science Art is actively encouraging the younger generation to get to know and understand TCM culture and its 5000 years of history by letting them come into actual contact with it, so as to pass on TCM knowledge and culture through the generations. In 2006, the Company hosted a “TCM Cultural Camp” initiated by the Singapore Ministry of Education. Nearly a hundred students and teachers from Raffles Junior College, Raffles Girls School, Dunman High School, Anglo-Chinese School (Independent), Nanyang Girls’ High School and Hwa Chong Institution participated in this event. Through this event, they learnt basic TCM knowledge such as Chinese herbs, acupuncture, massage therapy and TCM dietary therapy etc. As the event was very well received by the students, who displayed a deep interest in TCM culture, Science Arts decided to continue such educational activities to provide the younger generation with opportunities to learn the invaluable knowledge of TCM.

In addition, Science Arts has also collaborated with other organisations in order to promote TCM culture extensively. In July this year, our joint venture company Beijing Tong Ren Tang Science Arts (Singapore) Co. Pte Ltd signed a memorandum with the Confucius Institute at NTU to propagate Chinese and TCM culture through the promotion of the Chinese language and culture, sharing of resources and the complementing of the synergistic strengths of both parties, so as to contribute to the well-being of the general public. The TCM healthcare talk series are jointly conducted with various parties and TCM professors and specialists are regularly engaged to explain to the general public the basic concepts of TCM healthcare and how to achieve healthcare goals through TCM.

In the years that Science Arts has promoted TCM culture, it has accumulated invaluable experiences in the research and development of drugs and in the field of medical and healthcare services. It has also brought together a number of veteran TCM professors and specialists. With such development background and foundation, Science Arts hopes to expand the areas and contents of training it provides through more systematic methods, structural planning and by consolidating its manpower and resources. Hence, Science Arts has been actively undertaking preparatory work from 2006, hoping to establish a training centre that can popularise TCM culture, improve the professional standards of TCM physicians and pass on TCM culture.

After a long period of preparation, the Science Arts TCM College located at the Science Arts headquarters is finally established and will assume the important task of propagating TCM culture. The College hopes to promote and popularise TCM culture at all levels of the Singapore society and ethnic groups by actively offering a wide range of further specialists training and outreach programs. The College is also committed to the cultivation of interest and enthusiasm among the younger generation in TCM.",Learning and enrichment,Health talks,Monthly,Depends (e.g.2-6pm),No maximum age, Depends ,Science Arts TCM College,150 Macpherson Road,Science Arts Building,Singapore 348525,"Monday to Sunday: 10AM – 6PM Extended Hours on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday: 6PM – 8PM (Close on Public Holiday)",South East,call@tasa.sg,6744 8004 (Science Arts TCM College),367,SEED Institute,Private,www.seedinstitute.com.sg,"SEED Institute was formerly known as the Regional Training and Resource Centre in Early Childhood Care and Education for Asia (RTRC Asia).

The modern history of SGH began on 29 March 1926, with the opening of 800 beds in the Bowyer, Stanley and Norris Blocks. Today, only the Bowyer Block with its distinctive clock tower remains.

In 1981, the Hospital was rebuilt, with its current 8-block complex housing inpatient wards, ambulatory and support services, research laboratories and a postgraduate medical institute.

On 1 April 1989, the Hospital was restructured, paving the way for a more responsive organisation geared to cope with the rapid pace of change in healthcare services and patient expectations for better service. As a restructured hospital, SGH is still 100 per cent government-owned and is a not-for-profit institution. More than 60 per cent of our beds are allocated for subsidised patients, giving them access to a good standard of affordable healthcare.

Towards this end, the Association had mooted the idea of the World Largest Line Dance in 2001 which was later realized by NTUC Income in 2002. It then worked with Singapore Sports Council to provide course materials for its line dance classes during 2003-2005. The Association has also initiated and completed a 3-year Dancing For Health project, supported by C3A, over the period of 2008-2010 with the aim to introduce line dancing as a low impact activity to the seniors for a healthy lifestyle.

As part of the efforts to promote line dancing in Singapore, the Association has also invited international line dance choreographers and instructors, including Bill Bader, John Robinson, Masters In Line, Neil Hale and Jo Thompson, since 2000 to conduct workshops and activities. A popular line dance music artist, Scooter Lee, was brought in for a concert in 2003 too. In the year 2010, the Association brought in another popular artist, Dave Sheriff, to celebrate its 10th anniversary.

In its short existence of 11 years or so, the Association has worked with numerous public and private organizations to conduct line dance activities, including workshops, jams and performances.

The main role of SCDF is to provide fire-fighting, rescue and emergency ambulance services; mitigating hazardous materials incidents, as well as formulate, implement and enforce regulations on fire safety and civil defence shelter matters.

In 1982, the National Civil Defence Plan was launched which spearheaded the emergency preparedness for the nation. With the enactment of the Civil Defence Act in 1986, the SCDF was established as an independent organisation under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). In the same year, the Hotel New World collapse paved the way for joint operations between the SCDF and Singapore Fire Service (SFS). Due to the similarity in roles and functions, the SCDF and SFS were formally integrated on 15 April 1989.
