On behalf of the management team, I sincerely welcome all of you to join the big family at June’s Beauty School. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for trusting us with the solemn duty of educating you and preparing you to face the challenging world ahead. June’s Beauty School was registered and set up in Singapore in 1973. It was one of earliest private schools in Singapore providing courses in beauty and hair with a systematic and methodical approach.

Over the years, many students have walked through our school doors and gone on to be very successful in their respective fields, working as consultants, trainers, beauticians, hair stylists, and even as entrepreneurs and owners of salons.

In our thirty seven years of teaching, we have never stopped improving; developing course content and content delivery methods to suit the times. Even as knowledge in skin care and hair care has grown, and fashionable styles in make-up and hair design have come and gone, some things remain constant. At June’s Beauty School, we constantly emphasize good service, passion and dedication to the profession of beauty and hair styling and the willingness to constantly upgrade one’s skill and knowledge. 

The proof of our service quality is shown in our achievement of CaseTrust certification in 2006. Our school has also been registered under the Enhanced Registration Framework in 2010 and is currently in the process of applying for EduTrust certification (to replace CaseTrust which will no longer be recognized under the new administration of Council for Private Education). Even as we apply for EduTrust certification, we will adhere to the guideline stipulated under EduTrust Certification Scheme, especially with regards of protecting your money under FPS, and your health under the health insurance scheme. 

With all that said, we sincerely hope you will feel at home at June’s Beauty School, especially for those of you who hail from overseas. At June’s Beauty School, we are always willing to lend a hand or a listening ear, so please, do not hesitate to ask for help in anything.
