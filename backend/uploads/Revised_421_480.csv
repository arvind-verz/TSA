Towards this end, the Association had mooted the idea of the World Largest Line Dance in 2001 which was later realized by NTUC Income in 2002. It then worked with Singapore Sports Council to provide course materials for its line dance classes during 2003-2005. The Association has also initiated and completed a 3-year Dancing For Health project, supported by C3A, over the period of 2008-2010 with the aim to introduce line dancing as a low impact activity to the seniors for a healthy lifestyle.

As part of the efforts to promote line dancing in Singapore, the Association has also invited international line dance choreographers and instructors, including Bill Bader, John Robinson, Masters In Line, Neil Hale and Jo Thompson, since 2000 to conduct workshops and activities. A popular line dance music artist, Scooter Lee, was brought in for a concert in 2003 too. In the year 2010, the Association brought in another popular artist, Dave Sheriff, to celebrate its 10th anniversary.

In its short existence of 11 years or so, the Association has worked with numerous public and private organizations to conduct line dance activities, including workshops, jams and performances.
