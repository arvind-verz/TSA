366,Science Arts TCM College,Private,http://www.sciencearts.com/main/en/tcm-college,"Science Arts Co. Pte Ltd is a local TCM company with 40 years of history. While manufacturing and managing Chinese proprietary medicine, it also provides TCM medical and healthcare services. Hence, it is a multi-faceted enterprise that is able to integrate both medication and clinical treatment to offer a seamless service. At the same time, Science Arts strongly believes that TCM is beneficial to everyone in the society, regardless of their ethnic and cultural background. For a long time, Science Arts has regarded the fostering of TCM culture and the promotion of public health as its aspiration.

Through the development of TCM in Singapore, the founders of Science Arts realise that TCM is a trusted medical science for the Chinese community in Singapore in the treatment of illnesses and the maintenance of health. With the rapid economic development in Singapore, TCM has great developmental potential. Since the 1990s, the value of TCM in healthcare has been widely recognised. In order to protect the safety and interests of the citizens, the Government has passed legislative regulatory measures for TCM, thereby enhancing the quality of TCM, making TCM one of the trusted medical treatment options for the public. With this development, TCM practitioners now bear greater social responsibilities and obligations. In order to safeguard public interests and maintain a competitive edge in the industry, practitioners have to constantly upgrade their specialised knowledge and refine their clinical skills so as to keep up with the times, to enable them to provide better and more professional services to the general public, alleviating their pains and illness while enhancing their health.

From years of accumulated experience, the management of Science Arts believes that in order for TCM to achieve sustainable development and to better serve the community, there is a need to enhance the confidence of the general public in TCM. Through further education provided outside of formal TCM training, the TCM industry is able to enhance the treatment efficacy of TCM; on the other hand, by educating the general public, it enables them to have the proper knowledge and understanding of TCM medical and healthcare services. Over the past few years, Science Arts has been committed to the active propagation of TCM culture through different channels, spreading it in various forms.

Since the early 1990s, Science Arts has conducted several hundreds of TCM healthcare talks. Through these selfless exchanges between TCM specialists and the general public, accurate and scientific concepts and knowledge of TCM treatments and healthcare were transmitted to the public thereby fundamentally enhancing public health awareness and increasing the correct scientific understanding of TCM healthcare applications. The talks were highly popular and Science Arts will continue to hold such talks to share new TCM knowledge with the general public.

In recent years, TCM has developed rapidly in Singapore, with a significant increase in the number of local and overseas TCM college graduates practicing in Singapore. In order to let professional TCM physicians further their education, keep up with new developments and enhance their professional standards, Science Arts has conducted over 15 professional TCM training courses in the last 5 years. Highly experienced specialists and professors were engaged as lecturers for the courses which have seen over 400 participants attending. The courses conducted included “Preparation Workshop for TCM Physicians Registration Exam”, “TCM Bone Injury Massage (Tui-na) Techniques”, “Bone Therapy and Manipulation Techniques”, “Bone Therapy Massage Techniques”, ” Essential Nutrients for the Human Body – Dietary Planning and Supplements”, “X-ray Diagnosis and Application of Massage (Tui-na) Techniques for Bone Injuries & Illnesses” and “Family Massage (Tui-na) Techniques” etc. These courses were very well received and have also attracted the participation of many TCM enthusiasts.

At the same time, Science Art is actively encouraging the younger generation to get to know and understand TCM culture and its 5000 years of history by letting them come into actual contact with it, so as to pass on TCM knowledge and culture through the generations. In 2006, the Company hosted a “TCM Cultural Camp” initiated by the Singapore Ministry of Education. Nearly a hundred students and teachers from Raffles Junior College, Raffles Girls School, Dunman High School, Anglo-Chinese School (Independent), Nanyang Girls’ High School and Hwa Chong Institution participated in this event. Through this event, they learnt basic TCM knowledge such as Chinese herbs, acupuncture, massage therapy and TCM dietary therapy etc. As the event was very well received by the students, who displayed a deep interest in TCM culture, Science Arts decided to continue such educational activities to provide the younger generation with opportunities to learn the invaluable knowledge of TCM.

In addition, Science Arts has also collaborated with other organisations in order to promote TCM culture extensively. In July this year, our joint venture company Beijing Tong Ren Tang Science Arts (Singapore) Co. Pte Ltd signed a memorandum with the Confucius Institute at NTU to propagate Chinese and TCM culture through the promotion of the Chinese language and culture, sharing of resources and the complementing of the synergistic strengths of both parties, so as to contribute to the well-being of the general public. The TCM healthcare talk series are jointly conducted with various parties and TCM professors and specialists are regularly engaged to explain to the general public the basic concepts of TCM healthcare and how to achieve healthcare goals through TCM.

In the years that Science Arts has promoted TCM culture, it has accumulated invaluable experiences in the research and development of drugs and in the field of medical and healthcare services. It has also brought together a number of veteran TCM professors and specialists. With such development background and foundation, Science Arts hopes to expand the areas and contents of training it provides through more systematic methods, structural planning and by consolidating its manpower and resources. Hence, Science Arts has been actively undertaking preparatory work from 2006, hoping to establish a training centre that can popularise TCM culture, improve the professional standards of TCM physicians and pass on TCM culture.

After a long period of preparation, the Science Arts TCM College located at the Science Arts headquarters is finally established and will assume the important task of propagating TCM culture. The College hopes to promote and popularise TCM culture at all levels of the Singapore society and ethnic groups by actively offering a wide range of further specialists training and outreach programs. The College is also committed to the cultivation of interest and enthusiasm among the younger generation in TCM.",Learning and enrichment,Health talks,Monthly,Depends (e.g.2-6pm),No maximum age, Depends ,Science Arts TCM College,150 Macpherson Road,Science Arts Building,Singapore 348525,"Monday to Sunday: 10AM – 6PM Extended Hours on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday: 6PM – 8PM (Close on Public Holiday)",South East,call@tasa.sg,6744 8004 (Science Arts TCM College)

It later shifted to Pearl's Bank and then to the Kandang Kerbau district, before finally settling at Sepoy Lines in Outram Road in 1882.

The modern history of SGH began on 29 March 1926, with the opening of 800 beds in the Bowyer, Stanley and Norris Blocks. Today, only the Bowyer Block with its distinctive clock tower remains.

In 1981, the Hospital was rebuilt, with its current 8-block complex housing inpatient wards, ambulatory and support services, research laboratories and a postgraduate medical institute.

On 1 April 1989, the Hospital was restructured, paving the way for a more responsive organisation geared to cope with the rapid pace of change in healthcare services and patient expectations for better service. As a restructured hospital, SGH is still 100 per cent government-owned and is a not-for-profit institution. More than 60 per cent of our beds are allocated for subsidised patients, giving them access to a good standard of affordable healthcare.

On 31 March 2000, following a major reorganisation of the public sector healthcare services initiated by the Ministry of Health, SGH came under the management of Singapore Health Services or SingHealth. The SingHealth Group is positioned to serve the eastern sector of Singapore through a cluster network of 3 hospitals, 5 specialist centres and 7 polyclinics.",Volunteering Opportunities,"Arts & Craft Programme, Retail Carts, Guider's Programme, Fund-raising & Ad-hoc programmes; Friend-of-SGH Programme",Depends,4 hours,NA, NA ,Singapore General Hospital,Outram Road,,Singapore 169608,Not Provided,Central,volunteer@sgh.com.sg,6321 4262
